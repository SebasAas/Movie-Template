### Stack

- React
- React-Redux for manage the state
- Redux-Persist to persist the data
- Firebase to serve the app
- Firestore as a DB

### Considerations

This project is using the API of [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), for that reason you need to create an account and copy the API Key (v3) from here https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api, and create an .env file in the root of the project and set the following

REACT_APP_API_KEY_TMDB="Your API Key"
